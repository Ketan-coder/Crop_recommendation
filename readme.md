# Django Crop Recommendation Project

## Introduction

This is a Django project for crop recommendation based on machine learning. The project uses Django for the web framework and includes functionality to take user input, predict the recommended crop using a machine learning model, and display the results.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine
- Git installed on your machine (optional, if you want to clone the repository)

## Setup

1. *You can download the project as a ZIP file and extract it.*

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

   On Windows:
   ```bash
   .\env\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS/Linux:
   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Run Migrations:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6. **Create a Superuser (Optional):**

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

7. **Run the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

   The development server will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
2. Fill out the form with the required information.
3. Submit the form to see the predicted crop.

## Issues and Solutions

- **Issue:** If you encounter issues with the virtual environment, try recreating it using the following commands:

    ```bash
    rm -rf env  # Remove existing virtual environment
    python -m venv env  # Create a new virtual environment
    ```

- **Issue:** If you face database-related issues during migrations, try resetting the database:

    ```bash
    rm db.sqlite3  # Remove the existing database file
    python manage.py migrate  # Run migrations again
    ```
